# lifhop Current Status

Last updated: 2026-10-02

## Current product slice

Phase 2.2 — provenance, observed versions, deletion suppression, and AI policy.
Phase 2.1 committed at `69dc764`; owner requested continuing without its HTML
preview check. Phase 2.2 implementation/local validation is complete. The owner
confirmed successful synthetic-demo execution (Entry 1270) and authorized the
commit; the complete browser scenarios in `HISTORY.md` remain pending.
Development DB upgraded to `a22b8c30d567`: all 1,266 existing Entries have one
initial observed version; source timestamps/history were not invented.
Local API health/new routes verified and import/purge worker restarted.
Next implementation after owner feedback: Phase 2.3 Codex historical backfill.

## Personal-release target

Finish private daily use before commercial service work. Prioritize past
solutions and decision reasons, then period retrospectives, then project
resumption; include ordinary life records without requiring a project.
The agreed additional sources are Codex CLI on one Mac and selected personal/
organization GitHub repositories, including accessible historical records.
Both need scheduled collection and collect-now controls. GitHub delivery starts
with commits and key documents; PRs/issues remain in scope.

The release must support access from other devices/external networks, prefer
AWS, and fit a combined hosting/storage/AI budget of USD 20/month. Version
retention, deletion suppression, and source/repository/record-level external-AI
exclusions are implemented foundations; full collectors remain upcoming.

## What works now

- FastAPI/PostgreSQL backend with authentication and user-owned Entries.
- Observed versions, explicit current pointer, source identity/locator/times,
  content/evidence SHA-256, parser/completeness and original-material links.
  Newer complete snapshots replace current; older/partial/unknown-time candidates
  remain inspectable. Unchanged replay has no duplicate Entry/version.
- Imported content read-only; separate personal annotations survive imports.
  Manual editing works. Browser history/provenance and explicit version selection.
- Confirmed source-deletion markers retain content; unavailable/unknown is distinct.
  Search explicitly filters source state and otherwise includes retained records.
- Lifhop deletion removes body/versions/annotations immediately, blocks reimport
  through minimal identities, and durably queues original purge in the worker.
  Shared ZIP deletion blocks/removes the entire raw object, preserving other text.
- Sources UI separates collection and AI permission; AI starts disabled at source
  and record levels. Egress guard checks every dependency/policy revision; mocked
  embeddings/reranking/summary/answer/telemetry deny tests pass. No AI provider is
  connected. Latest deletion-ledger export/apply protects isolated restores.
- Owner-scoped literal phrase search in title/content, combined source/type/date
  filters, total counts, and 20-record browser pagination. Search state lives in
  the URL and survives detail/create navigation.
- Title matches rank before body matches, then newest registration and ID. Dates
  are displayed/filtered in Asia/Seoul; registration and source/event dates are
  separate. Missing event dates are never inferred from text.
- New notes/Markdown imports have explicit provenance. Only old Markdown rows
  with matching owner/artifact MIME evidence are backfilled; other unproven
  sources remain unknown. User/date/ID index supports ordered browsing.
- Browser Markdown/ChatGPT ZIP upload, job polling/history, saved progress counts,
  sanitized item errors, paginated result Entries, retry, and protected originals.
- Local SeaweedFS storage and PostgreSQL ImportJob queue are defaults; explicit
  AWS S3/SQS modes remain available. Worker startup is separate from the API.
- Original artifact links on newly imported Entries; persisted job result IDs.
- ZIP upload/download uses bounded streams and temporary files. Legacy and
  numbered conversation JSON arrays are parsed one record at a time. Defaults:
  ZIP 1 GiB, declared archive 1 GiB, JSON 256 MiB, one record 16 MiB.
- Entries and progress commit together every 25 items. An owner session lock on
  a pinned PostgreSQL connection serializes imports across commits. Interrupted
  attempts resume from durable counts; full item-error retries replay the file.
  Three attempts, completed-delivery no-op, and item savepoints remain.
- S3-backed Entry attachments.
- Local S3-compatible storage is the default for development; tests block
  unexpected AWS client creation.
- React login, Entry list/detail, and note creation/editing/deletion using
  authenticated Entry APIs and server-result cache updates.
- English interface labels, instructions, job statuses, and frontend error messages.
  Dates use English formatting in Asia/Seoul; user content retains its language.
- Empty/loading/error states, draft-preserving save errors, title validation,
  deletion confirmation, and account-switch cache clearing.
- Read-only Codex/GitHub verification CLI produces private local HTML/JSON previews,
  with source IDs/dates, command outcomes/diffs, coverage, and omissions. No Entry
  writes, uploads, model execution, or scheduled collection.
- Codex CLI 0.158.0 official app-server reads run against disposable rollout/history
  DB copies. Local inventory: 169 files; selected historical sample: 3 turns,
  22 command items and 3 file-change items; list/turn pagination verified.
- Selected public GitHub repository `moonkongv2/jy_yamyam`: 3 branches inventoried,
  only `main` selected; 372 reachable commits across 4 pages. One commit's 2 file
  patches and README at its pinned SHA verified through anonymous REST GET.
- Disposable PostgreSQL tests use real migrations in fresh schemas. Local
  checks: 211 backend tests (25 acquisition and 25 history/policy cases) and 30 frontend tests pass;
  frontend lint/build pass.
- Actual local HTTP/S3/worker checks passed with a 512 MiB synthetic ZIP and a
  494 MiB owner archive in isolated schemas. Original hashes, search counts,
  reimport uniqueness, visible progress, and synthetic worker-kill recovery passed.
  Worker peak RSS was about 119/211 MiB respectively; these are local measurements.
  Test objects/schemas were removed.
- Phase 2.2 real HTTP/SeaweedFS synthetic Markdown/shared-ZIP deletion checks
  passed in an isolated transaction/schema: blocked downloads, removed objects,
  retained sibling text, and rollback cleanup. Actual AWS purge is unverified.
- GitHub Actions checks for migrations, backend/frontend tests, generated API
  types, and frontend lint/build (remote workflow execution pending).

The learning-through-F3 baseline is marked by Git tag
`learning-complete-f3` at `187b651f9422e901059f238c334d0e5fa885b4f4`.
The project remains a learning project; delivery from here follows the
user-verifiable product slices in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Next

1. Verify Phase 2.2 using `HISTORY.md`: synthetic history, annotations, source
   markers, deletion/reimport block, and Sources permissions.
2. Follow the sequence: Codex/GitHub history → evidence-based answers/retrospectives
   → scheduled collectors → private AWS release.

## Known limitations

- Owner confirmed the initial and large-ZIP Phase 1.2 flows in the browser.
  Phase 1.3, English UI, and Phase 2.1 owner preview checks remain pending.
  Remote CI execution remains pending; frontend automated tests stub API.
- Search is literal case-insensitive substring matching; no word stemming, fuzzy
  matching, relevance model, attachment text extraction, or LLM answers. Large
  real-corpus performance is unverified; ranked searches/counts scan owned rows.
- Offset pages can shift when records change concurrently. Timezone is initially
  fixed to Asia/Seoul; changing it in user settings is not available.
- Recent job history shows the latest 20 jobs; Entry lists/job results paginate.
- Progress updates at batch commits. Preflight validation initially shows zero
  total; upload byte percentages are not shown. Textless active branches appear
  as EMPTY_CONVERSATION errors and can produce a PARTIAL result.
- Earlier imported Entries/jobs have no reconstructed missing artifact/result
  links. Existing duplicate Markdown rows are preserved separately; future
  identical uploads match their initial canonical byte identity. Explicit document
  IDs and verified source modification times track changed Markdown versions.
- Codex/GitHub checks are local previews; actual history ingestion,
  backfill and scheduled collection are not implemented.
  Codex reads require installed CLI 0.158.0 and bounded disposable snapshots.
  Other recorded versions, archived contents, private repos, organization SSO,
  and expiring-token access are not verified with real samples. Preview truncation
  and incomplete secret redaction require reports to stay private. Full collection
  volume and deployment cost still need verification.
- The ChatGPT Web extension is experimental and currently unreliable on
  affected pages. Do not use it as the product's dependable capture path.
- Attachment storage does not extract PDF or image content for search.
- Browser access tokens are stored in localStorage for development only;
  review production authentication before internet deployment.
- Queue redrive/DLQ, the crash window between DB commit and AWS SQS enqueue,
  production worker supervision, and broader observability remain follow-up.
- Source deletion confirmation is manual until adapters reconcile source state.
  Missing/equal source modification times require explicit version review.
- Original purge needs the worker; already issued download URLs can work up to
  10 minutes or object removal. Attachment final purge waits 11 minutes because
  upload URLs remain valid after completion. Real AWS version deletion/IAM,
  automatic policy/deletion journaling, backups and 30-day expiry are unverified
  deployment work. Old uploads without known Entry links cannot be safely purged
  by attribution. Restore must apply latest deletion ledger and current denies.
- Worker recovery uses RUNNING age (processing limit + 60 seconds) and owner locks;
  hard process termination is not a wall-clock timeout guarantee.

See `DECISIONS.md` and `CAPTURE.md` for enduring architecture and capture
constraints. Historical step-by-step status is available at the learning
baseline tag.

## Local validation incident

An initial integration script loaded DB settings before its test environment and
misdirected cleanup. The two affected local originals were restored byte-for-byte
from retained SeaweedFS data; one historical job start timestamp was restored
from its previous PostgreSQL row version. The script now verifies the disposable
DB/schema and cleans only object keys created by that invocation. Two September
artifact metadata rows have no verified local original; their availability before
this incident is unknown. No Entry bodies were changed by that script.
