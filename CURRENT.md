## Current product slice

Codex session browsing and message-phase checkpoint after Phase 2.3: implemented
and locally verified; owner browser verification pending. Plan committed at
`bdfcd57`; session implementation is committed at `ab40b30`, with saved-title
support committed in this checkpoint. Development DB upgraded to
`c04d8a12e673`. Phase 2.3 implementation is committed at `36de1de` with whitespace
cleanup at `63f0c1a`; owner confirmed its preview. Personal apply remains unverified.
Phase 2.1 committed at `69dc764`; owner requested continuing without its HTML
preview check. Phase 2.2 committed at `d99ef9e`. The owner
confirmed successful synthetic-demo execution (Entry 1270) and authorized the
commit; the complete browser scenarios in `HISTORY.md` remain pending.
Phase 2.2 migration `a22b8c30d567` gave all 1,266 existing Entries one
initial observed version; source timestamps/history were not invented.
Local API health/new routes verified and import/purge worker restarted.
The owner requested a Notebook-inspired frontend refresh before further collection
work, followed by separating Search from recent Entries. Implementation and local
checks are complete. The owner requested English-control/session fixes after
browser review and authorized committing the UI checkpoint. The broader visual
walkthrough remains available in `frontend/README.md`.
UI checkpoint: `19e395a`. Next implementation: Phase 2.4 GitHub historical backfill.

## Personal-release target

Finish private daily use before commercial service work. Prioritize past
solutions and decision reasons, then period retrospectives, then project
resumption; include ordinary life records without requiring a project.
The agreed additional sources are Codex CLI on one Mac and selected personal/
organization GitHub repositories, including accessible historical records.
Both need scheduled collection and collect-now controls. GitHub delivery starts
with commits and key documents; PRs/issues remain in scope.

The release must support access from other devices/external networks, prefer
AWS, and fit a combined hosting/storage/AI budget of USD 20/month. Version
retention, deletion suppression, and source/repository/record-level external-AI
exclusions are implemented foundations; full collectors remain upcoming.

## What works now

- Entries groups current Codex turns by owner/scope/thread before server pagination;
  other records remain individual. Sessions retain fork/archive/gap metadata,
  inferred-order warnings, lazy turn reading and focus links from Search.
  Final answers and unknown messages stay in primary reading/search; explicitly
  classified commentary stays in Work details and an optional search scope.
  Per-turn history, annotation, delete/suppression and AI permission remain intact.
  Current-version primary_content is derived separately; existing bodies/hashes
  remain unchanged. v1 manifests/receipts remain valid, v2 records phase/order.
  Session titles prefer saved Codex names; fallback titles normalize whitespace
  and cap display at 60 characters plus an ellipsis. First questions appear in
  separate two-line card previews. Original turn titles/content remain unchanged.
- Latest checks: 248 backend tests, 83 frontend tests, lint/build and whitespace
  checks pass. Real loopback HTTP/isolated-schema verification covers 25 synthetic
  turns, search scope, grouped count/focus and replay without duplicate versions.
  Synthetic Chromium checks pass at 320/390/768/1440px with no page errors.
  An initial full run's health test used an offline development DB; corrected
  DATABASE_URL/TEST_DATABASE_URL isolated settings passed. Frontend old list/cache
  assertions were updated for archive; an initial browser stub intercepted module
  imports and was corrected. No unresolved check failures remain.
  The added snapshot-index test initially called a yielded generator as a function;
  correcting that test passed. Saved-name sanitization, latest valid index row,
  legacy serialization, name priority and fallback/preview are covered.
  Final targeted rerun hit sandbox TCP restrictions; the approved host rerun
  passed all 28 collector/session tests. No application failure remained.
- Installed CLI 0.160.0 schemas and actual bounded reads verified: 33 turns from
  10 selected readable lifhop sessions, with 63 commentary and 32 final messages.
  Original v1 preview's 33 payload digests remain unchanged. New private v2 preview
  is `.local/verification/codex-session-v2/preview`; it has not been uploaded.
  A separate title-verified preview at `.local/verification/codex-session-titles-verified/preview`
  captures saved names for 4 sessions/25 turns. The owner's local apply checkpoint
  acknowledges all 33 turns; final run status and current-version UI are unverified.
  `scripts/seed_codex_session_demo.py` creates an explicit synthetic 25-turn local
  source for user checks. See CODEX_BACKFILL.md.
- Codex CLI 0.158.0 manual backfill: explicit project/thread selection, exclusions
  and date filters, immutable private sanitized preview, device-scoped turn IDs,
  bounded official reads against disposable snapshots and explicit gaps.
  Authenticated direct HTTP apply saves Entry/version and receipt atomically;
  interruption/lost acknowledgment can resume without duplication. Server receipts
  verify local checkpoint skips. Ownership, collection policy, deletion suppression,
  annotations and AI-off defaults are preserved. No S3, worker or new AWS service
  is required for Codex text ingestion. Sources displays paginated runs/coverage;
  Search and version inspection show ordered recorded evidence and omissions.
  See `CODEX_BACKFILL.md` for execution and verification.
- Phase 2.3 checks: 237 backend tests with fresh-schema migrations, including actual
  loopback HTTP synthetic apply/replay and pre-commit rollback; 80 frontend tests,
  lint/build pass. Synthetic Chromium Sources/search/evidence/failure/retry checks
  pass at 320/390/768/1440px. A final-suite setup attempt used the wrong test DB
  account; the corrected rerun passed. Actual private preview selected 13 of 171
  files, read 10 sessions, failed 3 and prepared 33 turns; SOURCE_CONFLICT and
  EMPTY_HISTORY remain gaps. Personal source content has not been uploaded.
- FastAPI/PostgreSQL backend with authentication and user-owned Entries.
- Observed versions, explicit current pointer, source identity/locator/times,
  content/evidence SHA-256, parser/completeness and original-material links.
  Newer complete snapshots replace current; older/partial/unknown-time candidates
  remain inspectable. Unchanged replay has no duplicate Entry/version.
- Imported content read-only; separate personal annotations survive imports.
  Manual editing works. Browser history/provenance and explicit version selection.
- Confirmed source-deletion markers retain content; unavailable/unknown is distinct.
  Search explicitly filters source state and otherwise includes retained records.
- Lifhop deletion removes body/versions/annotations immediately, blocks reimport
  through minimal identities, and durably queues original purge in the worker.
  Shared ZIP deletion blocks/removes the entire raw object, preserving other text.
- Sources UI separates collection and AI permission; AI starts disabled at source
  and record levels. Egress guard checks every dependency/policy revision; mocked
  embeddings/reranking/summary/answer/telemetry deny tests pass. No AI provider is
  connected. Latest deletion-ledger export/apply protects isolated restores.
- Owner-scoped literal phrase search in title/content, combined source/type/date
  filters, total counts, and 20-record browser pagination. Search has its own
  `/search` screen; `/entries` shows recent records. Empty Search makes no API
  request; keyword and filter-only searches apply on submission. Old filtered
  `/entries` URLs redirect to Search. Validated detail return URLs preserve
  origin, conditions and page across sidebar navigation, reload and new tabs.
  Entries pagination survives note creation/cancellation.
- Title matches rank before body matches, then newest registration and ID. Dates
  are displayed/filtered in Asia/Seoul; registration and source/event dates are
  separate. Missing event dates are never inferred from text.
- New notes/Markdown imports have explicit provenance. Only old Markdown rows
  with matching owner/artifact MIME evidence are backfilled; other unproven
  sources remain unknown. User/date/ID index supports ordered browsing.
- Browser Markdown/ChatGPT ZIP upload, job polling/history, saved progress counts,
  sanitized item errors, paginated result Entries, retry, and protected originals.
- Local SeaweedFS storage and PostgreSQL ImportJob queue are defaults; explicit
  AWS S3/SQS modes remain available. Worker startup is separate from the API.
- Original artifact links on newly imported Entries; persisted job result IDs.
- ZIP upload/download uses bounded streams and temporary files. Legacy and
  numbered conversation JSON arrays are parsed one record at a time. Defaults:
  ZIP 1 GiB, declared archive 1 GiB, JSON 256 MiB, one record 16 MiB.
- Entries and progress commit together every 25 items. An owner session lock on
  a pinned PostgreSQL connection serializes imports across commits. Interrupted
  attempts resume from durable counts; full item-error retries replay the file.
  Three attempts, completed-delivery no-op, and item savepoints remain.
- S3-backed Entry attachments.
- Local S3-compatible storage is the default for development; tests block
  unexpected AWS client creation.
- React login, Entry list/detail, and note creation/editing/deletion using
  authenticated Entry APIs and server-result cache updates.
- English interface labels, instructions, job statuses, and frontend error messages.
  Dates use English formatting in Asia/Seoul; user content retains its language.
  Search/Markdown date controls use an English calendar and `YYYY-MM-DD`;
  Markdown time uses `HH:mm` in the device timezone. File selection and form
  validation messages stay English even with a Korean browser locale.
  Login changes to Logout after authentication. Logout clears tokens/private
  query caches, redirects to Login, and propagates to other tabs. API 401 responses
  end the matching session with an English notice; stale responses cannot restore
  the previous session's record cache.
- Light panel UI: collapsible Search filters and preview cards; detail record navigation,
  full-text reader, and annotations/history. Import, Sources, job, note, and login
  pages share the same styles. Narrow screens stack panels. Delete lives in the
  record actions menu with an explicit confirmation near the top of the reader.
  Switching records resets the previous edit state and preserves list filters.
- Empty/loading/error states, draft-preserving save errors, title validation,
  deletion confirmation, and account-switch cache clearing.
- Read-only Codex/GitHub verification CLI produces private local HTML/JSON previews,
  with source IDs/dates, command outcomes/diffs, coverage, and omissions. These
  Phase 2.1 commands do no Entry writes, uploads, model execution or scheduling;
  Phase 2.3 adds a separate explicit Codex apply command.
- Codex CLI 0.158.0 official app-server reads run against disposable rollout/history
  DB copies. Local inventory: 169 files; selected historical sample: 3 turns,
  22 command items and 3 file-change items; list/turn pagination verified.
- Selected public GitHub repository `moonkongv2/jy_yamyam`: 3 branches inventoried,
  only `main` selected; 372 reachable commits across 4 pages. One commit's 2 file
  patches and README at its pinned SHA verified through anonymous REST GET.
- Disposable PostgreSQL tests use real migrations in fresh schemas. Local
  Phase 2.2 checks: 211 backend tests (25 acquisition and 25 history/policy cases).
  UI checkpoint checks: 79 frontend tests, lint/build pass; backend unchanged.
  Local Chromium checks with synthetic API responses cover Entries, Search initial/
  results, detail, Import, Sources, job, login and new note at desktop/mobile sizes,
  plus 320/768/1024/1280px layouts. Search submission, filter-only queries, reset,
  legacy redirects, new-tab/reload return context, active menu, deletion cancellation,
  history, annotations and draft reset pass.
  Korean-locale Chromium checks also pass for English date/time/file controls,
  calendar selection and viewport bounds, login/logout, logout after reload,
  cross-tab logout and expired-session redirects. No application Korean labels
  remain in the source audit; Korean user-content fixtures remain intentional.
  This UI check does not establish actual DB/storage integration.
- Actual local HTTP/S3/worker checks passed with a 512 MiB synthetic ZIP and a
  494 MiB owner archive in isolated schemas. Original hashes, search counts,
  reimport uniqueness, visible progress, and synthetic worker-kill recovery passed.
  Worker peak RSS was about 119/211 MiB respectively; these are local measurements.
  Test objects/schemas were removed.
- Phase 2.2 real HTTP/SeaweedFS synthetic Markdown/shared-ZIP deletion checks
  passed in an isolated transaction/schema: blocked downloads, removed objects,
  retained sibling text, and rollback cleanup. Actual AWS purge is unverified.
- GitHub Actions checks for migrations, backend/frontend tests, generated API
  types, and frontend lint/build (remote workflow execution pending).

The learning-through-F3 baseline is marked by Git tag
`learning-complete-f3` at `187b651f9422e901059f238c334d0e5fa885b4f4`.
The project remains a learning project; delivery from here follows the
user-verifiable product slices in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Next

1. Verify session browsing/message separation with the synthetic helper in
   CODEX_BACKFILL.md; review the new private v2 preview before any personal apply.
   Conversation-only reading follows as a separate commit.
2. Explicitly apply a reviewed private Phase 2.3 preview; verify Sources,
   Codex search/evidence, replay, annotations and disposable deletion/policy checks
   in `CODEX_BACKFILL.md`. The owner confirmed preview review and authorized
   committing the implementation before personal apply.
3. Implement Phase 2.4 GitHub historical backfill after the current slice is verified.
4. Verify Phase 2.2 using `HISTORY.md`: synthetic history, annotations, source
   markers, deletion/reimport block, and Sources permissions.
5. Follow the sequence: Codex/GitHub history → evidence-based answers/retrospectives
   → scheduled collectors → private AWS release.

## Known limitations

- Legacy assistant phases and missing turn positions stay unknown. Same-time v2
  observations can be retained candidates requiring explicit current selection.
  Session counts describe retained turns, not full source coverage. Session-wide
  deletion/settings are not implemented. JSONB grouping was checked on small
  synthetic data; large-corpus performance is unverified. Concurrent offset pages
  can shift. Owner actual-history UI/mobile-device checks remain pending.
- Owner confirmed the initial and large-ZIP Phase 1.2 flows in the browser.
  Phase 1.3, English UI, and Phase 2.1 owner preview checks remain pending.
  Remote CI execution remains pending; frontend automated tests stub API.
- Refreshed UI owner review is pending. Chromium layout/interaction checks use
  synthetic API responses; other browser engines and actual mobile devices remain
  unverified. Theme is light; a dark theme is not implemented.
  OS file-picker dialogs and browser-owned menus can use the device language.
- Search is literal case-insensitive substring matching; no word stemming, fuzzy
  matching, relevance model, attachment text extraction, or LLM answers. Large
  real-corpus performance is unverified; ranked searches/counts scan owned rows.
- Offset pages can shift when records change concurrently. Timezone is initially
  fixed to Asia/Seoul; changing it in user settings is not available.
- Recent job history shows the latest 20 jobs; Entry lists/job results paginate.
- Progress updates at batch commits. Preflight validation initially shows zero
  total; upload byte percentages are not shown. Textless active branches appear
  as EMPTY_CONVERSATION errors and can produce a PARTIAL result.
- Earlier imported Entries/jobs have no reconstructed missing artifact/result
  links. Existing duplicate Markdown rows are preserved separately; future
  identical uploads match their initial canonical byte identity. Explicit document
  IDs and verified source modification times track changed Markdown versions.
- GitHub ingestion and scheduled collection are not implemented. Codex backfill
  is implemented, but personal apply/browser verification remains pending.
  Codex backfill supports installed CLI 0.158.0/0.160.0 with bounded snapshots;
  the separate Phase 2.1 probe remains pinned to 0.158.0.
  conflicts, empty legacy responses and unknown/divergent snapshots remain gaps.
  Other installed CLI versions, private repos, organization SSO,
  and expiring-token access are not verified with real samples. Preview truncation
  and incomplete secret redaction require reports to stay private. Full collection
  volume and deployment cost still need verification.
- The ChatGPT Web extension is experimental and currently unreliable on
  affected pages. Do not use it as the product's dependable capture path.
- Attachment storage does not extract PDF or image content for search.
- Browser access tokens are stored in localStorage for development only;
  review production authentication before internet deployment.
- Queue redrive/DLQ, the crash window between DB commit and AWS SQS enqueue,
  production worker supervision, and broader observability remain follow-up.
- Source deletion confirmation is manual until adapters reconcile source state.
  Missing/equal source modification times require explicit version review.
- Original purge needs the worker; already issued download URLs can work up to
  10 minutes or object removal. Attachment final purge waits 11 minutes because
  upload URLs remain valid after completion. Real AWS version deletion/IAM,
  automatic policy/deletion journaling, backups and 30-day expiry are unverified
  deployment work. Old uploads without known Entry links cannot be safely purged
  by attribution. Restore must apply latest deletion ledger and current denies.
- Worker recovery uses RUNNING age (processing limit + 60 seconds) and owner locks;
  hard process termination is not a wall-clock timeout guarantee.

See `DECISIONS.md` and `CAPTURE.md` for enduring architecture and capture
constraints. Historical step-by-step status is available at the learning
baseline tag.

## Local validation incident

An initial integration script loaded DB settings before its test environment and
misdirected cleanup. The two affected local originals were restored byte-for-byte
from retained SeaweedFS data; one historical job start timestamp was restored
from its previous PostgreSQL row version. The script now verifies the disposable
DB/schema and cleans only object keys created by that invocation. Two September
artifact metadata rows have no verified local original; their availability before
this incident is unknown. No Entry bodies were changed by that script.
